# express-delivery-routes

## Description

This project demonstrates my knowledge of creating a back-end database using express routes and Sequelize, as demonstrated through an Insomnia walkthrough video.
It uses the mySQL models that have a theme of "commerce". Technology involved JavaScript, NodeJS, MySQL2, Sequelize, Dotenv, Express, Insomnia

## Installation

You will need to run npm i to get the needed dependencies. Then, copy the .env file with your own credentials. Next, run the mysql database using mysql -uroot -p < db/schema.sql. Then, npm run seed and lastly, npm start. You can now head over to Insomnia and create the necessary requests (see my video example below).
